## Install

The recommend way to install is over [pelican-themes](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes).

The `master` branch is the development branch. If you're happy with fresh new things and maybe sometimes (~most of time~) broken things you can clone the `master`, but I would recommend to you to clone a tag branch.

## Migrate from 1.x to 2.x

Release 2.0 will include [Translation Support](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex/wiki/Multi-language-support). In order to use Flex you need to configure your `pelicanconf.py` to support i18n. See [Multi language support](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex/wiki/Multi-language-support) for examples.
